Create an online shopping cart using ArrayList 
to store the items selected by user, 
Allow user to add items to the cart , 
remove items , calculate total price, 
and display the items in the cart.

classProduct: name, price
the program allows users to interact with the online shopping cart.
They can add items to cart, remove by index, calculate the total price and
display the items present in the cart.
The program use Product class to represent items and ShoppingCart class 
encapsulates the cart operations.
Users can select options from menu, add then program handles the corresponding
oprations accordingly. menu driven.





2) Linked List

linear data structure .
it is stored as an object in non- contiguous memory locations.
two things are stored. 
value and nextAddressLocation or previousAddress.

i) singly linked list: Each object stores data and next address.
Only traversal is single directional.



LinkedList<> a = new LinkedList<>();

3) Student Grading System:

develop a student Grading System using 
linked list to store student objects with their 
grades. Implement functionalities like adding students,
calculate average grade, finding highest and lowest grades and display 
student details.

Implement student grading System using LinkedList as a queue.


menu:
1. addStudent
2. calculate avg
3. find highest grade student
4. find lowest grade student
5. display details
6. exit





methods :

peek() : returns head, but does not remove
peekFirst() : returns head or null
peekLast() : returns tail or null
pollFirst() : returns first element and removes element or null if element not present
pollLast() : returns last element and removes element or null if element not present
poll() : returns first element and removes element 
offer(E element) : add element as tail of the list
offerFirst(E element) : add element at front
offerLast(E element) : add at tail.





4)

Write a program to find the middle node of a 
singly linkedlist. If the length of the list is even
return second middle node. Implement a method which takes 
a head and returns the value.
