1) longest substring without repeating chars

ex: s = "abcabcbb"
ouput: 3
explanation : "abc" is longest

s = "pwwkew"
out: "wke"


2) What is constructor ?

Special method. It is invoked when an object is created.
To initialise class variables. Same name as class name
No return type.
1. Default constructor
2. Parameterized constructor

if u dont have a constructor in your class java compiler 
adds a Default constructor during compilation.

3) mostly used

toString()

charAt()
getChars()
getBytes()
toCharArray()

equals() and equalsIgnoreCase()
regionMatches()
startsWith() and endsWith()
compareTo()

substring()
concat()
replace()
trim()

Data Conversion:
valueOf()

String Buffer Constructors :
length() and capacity()
setLength()
charAT() and setCharAt()
getChars()
append()
insert()
reverse()
delete() and deleteCharAt()
replace()
substring()





ex:
String s = "Hello"
char[] ch = s.toCharArray();



4) Bank Account Management:

Create a class called 'BankAccount' that represents
a bank account. The 'BankAccount' class should have an instance variables such as 
'accountNumber' , 'accountHolderName', 'balance', etc.,
Write a constructor for the 'BankAccount' class that takes these parameters and initialises
the instance variables.
use the 'BankAccount' class to create bank account objects and simulate banking operations like
deposit, withdraw, and balance enquiry



5) Employee PayrollSystem 

Design a class called Employee that represents an Employee in a payroll system.
variables = employeeId, name, designation, salary
write constructor and initialise the instance variables
create objects and demonstrate their usage in a payroll system to 
calculate monthly salaries, give raises, and generate payroll reports.



6) 
Product Inventory Management:
class : Product
variables : ProductId, ProductName, price

methods : addnewProducts, updateProducts, calculateTotalInventoryValue

.
